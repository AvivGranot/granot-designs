REPLIT AGENT PROMPT: Fix Desktop Carousel to Match Horizontal Reference Layout
Primary Objective
Repair the broken desktop carousel layout. The current vertical stacking of images must be replaced with a horizontal, multi-image "peek" layout that clones the user experience from minaleandmann.com.

Critical Constraints (Do Not Violate)
DO NOT CHANGE THE MOBILE VERSION. All modifications MUST be contained within a desktop-specific media query (@media (min-width: 1024px)). The mobile layout is correct and must remain untouched.

DO NOT copy any text from the reference website. This task is purely about the image layout and structure.

DO NOT change any existing JavaScript or HTML rendering logic unless explicitly told to. This is a CSS-only task.

Problem Analysis
Current State (Desktop): As seen in the provided screenshot, all carousel images are collapsing into a single vertical column instead of a horizontal track. This indicates that the flexbox or grid properties are not being applied correctly on desktop screens.

Desired State (Desktop): The carousel should display three images simultaneously: one large, fully visible image in the center, with partial "peek" views of the previous and next images on either side. This matches the layout of the reference site.

Technical Implementation Steps
1. Locate the Primary Stylesheet:
Open the main CSS file for the project (likely style.css or a similar name).

2. Implement Desktop-Specific CSS Overrides:
Add the following CSS code block to the end of the stylesheet. Wrapping these rules in a media query is the most important step to protect the mobile design.

css
/* ============================================= */
/* == DESKTOP CAROUSEL LAYOUT CORRECTION      == */
/* ============================================= */
@media (min-width: 1024px) {

  /* 
   * STEP 1: Define the gallery track as a horizontal flex container.
   * This forces the slides to sit side-by-side.
   */
  .gallery-track {
    display: flex;
    overflow-x: auto;
    scroll-snap-type: x mandatory;
    scroll-behavior: smooth;
    /* Hide the scrollbar for a clean look */
    scrollbar-width: none; /* Firefox */
  }

  .gallery-track::-webkit-scrollbar {
    display: none; /* Chrome, Safari, Opera */
  }

  /* 
   * STEP 2: Give each slide a specific, non-shrinking width.
   * This is the key to preventing the vertical collapse.
   * We will make the main slide take up ~60% of the viewport width.
   */
  .gallery-slide {
    flex: 0 0 60vw;
    width: 60vw;
    height: 70vh; /* You can adjust this height as needed */
    scroll-snap-align: center; /* This ensures a slide snaps to the center */
  }

  /* 
   * STEP 3: Add padding to the parent container.
   * This creates the empty space on the sides that allows the adjacent
   * slides to "peek" into view. 
   * (100vw - 60vw) / 2 = 20vw padding on each side.
   */
  .horizontal-gallery {
    padding-left: 20vw;
    padding-right: 20vw;
  }
}
Verification and Testing Protocol
After applying the code, you must perform these checks:

Desktop View:

Refresh the page on a desktop browser.

Expected Result: The carousel should immediately display the "peek" layout with one central image and parts of two others.

Desktop Scrolling:

Use the mouse wheel or drag to scroll the carousel horizontally.

Expected Result: The carousel scrolls smoothly, with each image snapping into the central position.

Mobile View (CRITICAL TEST):

Resize the browser window to a mobile width (e.g., less than 768px).

Expected Result: The mobile layout must be completely unchanged. It should still display one full-slide image at a time. If it has been affected, the fix has failed.

Final Instruction for Agent: Your task is to apply these precise CSS rules within a desktop media query to fix the broken horizontal layout. The highest priority is to avoid any impact on the existing mobile design.
