REPLIT AGENT PROMPT — DESKTOP "PEEK" CAROUSEL UI
OBJECTIVE
Redesign the desktop carousel so that on wide screens (≥ 1024px), the user always sees:

A main centered “active” image (about 60–65% of carousel width)

Partial “peek” views of the previous and next images on the left and right sides (about 17–20% each)

Encourages horizontal scrolling just like on the reference architecture website

ANALYSIS
Current: Each carousel image takes up 100% of the visible area, so only one image is visible at a time (see attached screenshot).

Desired: Mimic the architecture site so three images are always partially visible at once: one fully, two partially (“peek” sides).

REQUIRED CHANGES
1. CSS for Responsive Desktop Peek Layout
Use a desktop media query (min-width: 1024px). Set the structure so:

Carousel container uses horizontal flex layout

Each .gallery-slide is 60vw (60% of viewport width)

Carousel container gets side paddings (e.g., 20vw or 17vw) to “peek” next/previous slides

Side gap between slides (e.g., 2vw or 32px)

Hide scrollbars for aesthetics

css
@media (min-width: 1024px) {
  .gallery-track {
    display: flex;
    overflow-x: auto;
    overflow-y: hidden;
    padding-left: 17vw;
    padding-right: 17vw;
    gap: 2vw;
    scroll-snap-type: x mandatory;
    scroll-behavior: smooth;
    scrollbar-width: none;
  }
  .gallery-track::-webkit-scrollbar {
    display: none;
  }
  .gallery-slide {
    flex: 0 0 60vw;
    max-width: 60vw;
    scroll-snap-align: center;
    position: relative;
  }
  .gallery-image {
    width: 100%;
    height: auto;
    border-radius: 10px;
  }
}
2. Ensure Desktop-Responsive Behavior
Do not break the mobile layout; only apply this layout on screens ≥ 1024px.

Keep all JavaScript scroll and navigation logic unchanged.

Scrolling with the mouse, touchpad, or arrows should work as before.

3. Test and Review
Test the carousel on both desktop and mobile:

On desktop: Three images (one large, two partial peeks). User always sees what’s next/previous.

On mobile: Your existing single-image full-screen layout remains.

Progress bar displays scrolling progress as before.

EXPECTED OUTCOME
Desktop: The carousel displays a large, centered image with a visible “peek” of the previous and next images, inviting horizontal interaction—matching the architecture website’s look and user experience.
Mobile: No change; still one image per screen.

Do not change your mobile styles. Only apply these changes for desktop screens (min-width: 1024px). The result must match the multi-image peek effect as demonstrated on the reference architecture site.
