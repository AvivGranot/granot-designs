Act as a full-stack developer and UI/UX designer. Update the existing single-page Hebrew carpentry site ("גרנות עיצובים") as follows:

**1. Navigation Icon – Elegance and Sophistication**
- Replace the current square navigation icon in the header with a more elegant, visually sophisticated icon.
- The new icon should:
  - Be minimalist, white (SVG or CSS), and evoke a modern, architectural theme.
  - Feature the "holed square" design shown in the third attached image, but with refined line weight, smooth corners, and subtle shadow for dimensionality.
  - The icon must not look blocky or simplistic; use round corners and balanced proportions for an upscale look.
  - Position the icon precisely, matching the spacing and alignment from the original reference design.

**2. Embedded Header Overlay Over Hero Section**
- The header background fill should not be solid black stuck above the hero image.
- Instead, the header must visually overlay the top of the hero section image (see attached reference), with the following specifications:
  - Make the header background semi-transparent black (`background: rgba(0,0,0,0.45)` or similar).
  - The title "גרנות עיצובים" and navigation icon must sit over the hero image, feeling embedded, NOT in a separate black bar.
  - As the page scrolls past the hero, the header should smoothly transition into a fully opaque dark background at the top (`background: #111` or similar).
  - Implement this effect using CSS “position: fixed” for the header, with a transition that detects scroll position and sets opacity/darkness appropriately.

**Styling and Performance**
- All text in the header must remain crisp white, bold, and highly readable.
- Ensure the visual transition from embedded/semi-transparent to solid/dark occurs smoothly (e.g., over 200ms).
- All work must be in index.html, style.css, and script.js. No external frameworks.
- Confirm the header is responsive, works equally well on mobile/desktop, and overlays seamlessly regardless of hero image dimensions.

**Summary**
- Task 1: Refine navigation icon for elegance, using a sophisticated SVG.
- Task 2: Rework header background to sit as a sleek overlay on the hero image, transitioning to fully dark only after scrolling below it.
