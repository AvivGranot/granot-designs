REPLIT AGENT PROMPT: Fix Desktop Carousel Layout Collapse
Objective
Repair the broken desktop carousel layout. The goal is to make the desktop carousel function and appear like the mobile version, where each image is a distinct slide in a horizontal track.

Problem Analysis
Current State (Desktop): All carousel images are being compressed and displayed vertically within the space of a single slide, as shown in the attached screenshot. This indicates a critical CSS layout issue.

Likely Cause: On desktop screen sizes, the .gallery-track container or the .gallery-slide items are missing the correct width and flex properties, causing them to collapse instead of aligning horizontally.

Crucial Constraint: The mobile version layout must not be changed. All fixes must apply only to screens wider than 1024px.

Technical Implementation
This task requires adding or correcting the CSS specifically for desktop screen sizes.

1. Locate the Stylesheet
Find the main CSS file (style.css or similar) where the carousel styles are defined.

2. Add a Desktop-Specific Media Query
Wrap the following CSS rules inside a media query to ensure they only apply to desktop. Do not alter any existing styles outside of this media query.

css
@media (min-width: 1024px) {

  /* Ensure the main track is a flex container */
  .gallery-track {
    display: flex;
    overflow-x: auto; /* Allow horizontal scrolling */
    scroll-snap-type: x mandatory;
    scrollbar-width: none; /* Hide scrollbar for a cleaner look */
  }

  .gallery-track::-webkit-scrollbar {
    display: none; /* Hide scrollbar for Chrome/Safari */
  }

  /* 
    Set a fixed, non-shrinkable width for each slide.
    This is the most critical part of the fix.
    We'll use the same peek layout as on mobile.
  */
  .gallery-slide {
    flex: 0 0 60vw;      /* Each slide takes 60% of the viewport width */
    max-width: 60vw;    /* Enforce the max width */
    height: 70vh;         /* Set an appropriate height for desktop */
    scroll-snap-align: center; /* Center the active slide */
  }
  
  /* Add padding to the container to create the peek effect */
  .horizontal-gallery {
    padding-left: 20vw;
    padding-right: 20vw;
  }
}
Testing and Verification Steps
Implement the CSS: Add the complete media query block to the end of the stylesheet.

Verify Desktop View: Refresh the page on a desktop browser. The carousel should now display correctly, with slides laid out horizontally in the "peek" formation (one main slide in the center and parts of the adjacent slides visible).

Test Desktop Scrolling: Confirm that you can scroll horizontally through all the slides using your mouse wheel or by dragging.

CRITICAL - Verify Mobile View: Resize the browser window to a mobile width (less than 1024px). The mobile layout must look and function exactly as it did before, with no changes.

Summary for Agent: The primary task is to fix the desktop CSS for .gallery-track and .gallery-slide by placing them inside a @media (min-width: 1024px) query. This will force the slides to align horizontally on desktop without affecting the already-working mobile design.
